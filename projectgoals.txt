find out what browser the user is using

  this can be done with useragentstring.com
  or whatismybrowser.com

take this information, and push it to

  caniuse.com

, for example,

  caniuse.com/#search=flexbox

-

caniuse.com uses a lot of javascript, so we need to
turn off javascript to determine if we can scrape a given page

we do this by going to

  hamburger menu devtools >
    > advanced settings
    > Privacy > Content settings...
    > Javascript > (*) Do not allow any site to run JavaScript

then we investigate the page, in this case caniuse.com,
to see what we have to work with in our webscraping.

with this information, we're going to generate a response to a
request specifying whether or not our browser supports
functionality for the feature specified in our url.
